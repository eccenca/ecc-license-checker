         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
            replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
            same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
            identification within third-party archives.

        TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION


        1. Definitions.


        "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and
        distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.


        "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by the
        copyright owner that is granting the License.


        "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other
        entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control
        with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means
        (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management
        of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of
        fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii)
        beneficial ownership of such entity.


        "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising
        permissions granted by this License.


        "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
        including but not limited to software source code, documentation source,
        and configuration files.


        "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
        transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not
        limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and
        conversions to other media types.


        "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object
        form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright
        notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is
        provided in the Appendix below).


        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
        form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
        editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.


        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original
        version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or
        Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor
        for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or
        Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For
        the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of
        electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its
        representatives, including but not limited to communication on
        electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue
        tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for
        the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding
        communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in
        writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."


        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on
        behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
        subsequently incorporated within the Work.


        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright
        license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
        publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such
        Derivative Works in Source or Object form.


        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
        License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
        non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in
        this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
        sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license
        applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that
        are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by
        combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
        Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
        against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
        lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within
        the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then
        any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work
        shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.


        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work
        or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the
        following conditions:


        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a
        copy of this License; and


        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating
        that You changed the files; and


        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
        distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices
        from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and


        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include
        a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE
        file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
        Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a
        NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the
        Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative
        Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the
        NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
        License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative
        Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE
        text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
        cannot be construed as modifying the License.


        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
        provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
        reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
        Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
        distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated
        in this License.


        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by
        You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this
        License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the
        above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any
        separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding
        such Contributions.


        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.


        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed
        to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides
        its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
        OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
        any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
        MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
        responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
        redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your
        exercise of permissions under this License.


        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless
        required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent
        acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You
        for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
        consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
        License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but
        not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
        failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
        losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of
        such damages.


        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the
        Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a
        fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
        obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in
        accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
        Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and
        only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
        harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such
        Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
        liability.

        are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by 

        combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such 

        Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation 

        against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a 

        lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within 

        the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then 

        any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work 

        shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.


        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work 

        or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without 

        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the 

        following conditions:


        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works
        a 

        copy of this License; and


        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating 

        that You changed the files; and


        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that
        You 

        distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices 

        from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not 

        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and


        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its 

        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
        include 

        a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE 

        file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the 

        Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a 

        NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within
        the 

        Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative 

        Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and 

        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the 

        NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the 

        License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative 

        Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE 

        text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices 

        cannot be construed as modifying the License.


        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may 

        provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, 

        reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such 

        Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and 

        distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated 

        in this License.


        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, 

        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by 

        You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this 

        License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding
        the 

        above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any 

        separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor
        regarding 

        such Contributions.


        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade 

        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, 

        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the 

        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.


        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed 

        to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor
        provides 

        its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
        CONDITIONS 

        OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, 

        any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, 

        MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely 

        responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or 

        redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your 

        exercise of permissions under this License.


        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, 

        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless 

        required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent 

        acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You 

        for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or 

        consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this 

        License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but 

        not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer 

        failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or 

        losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility
        of 

        such damages.


        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the 

        Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a 

        fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability 

        obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in 

        accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on 

        Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and 

        only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor 

        harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
        such 

        Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional 

        liability.
